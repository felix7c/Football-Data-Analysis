##Premier League 2021-2021 Data: Cards Given By Referees
Using a CSV file of Premier League Data from http://www.football-data.co.uk , I aggregated the yellow/red card data for each referee (both home games and away games), and joined these variables together into a datframe. From this, I calculated the differences in cards dished out in home games vs. away games for each referee. After melting the data into long format, I plotted these differences using ggplot.
